Which type of pets are adopted most often?
```{r}
# Count adoptions by animal type
adoptions_by_type <- longbeach %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "adoption") %>%
  group_by(animal_type) %>%
  summarise(total_adopted = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_adopted))

# Plot 
ggplot(adoptions_by_type, aes(x = reorder(animal_type, -total_adopted), y = total_adopted)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "coral") +
  labs(
    title = "Adoptions by Animal Type",
    x = "Animal Type",
    y = "Number of Adoptions"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
